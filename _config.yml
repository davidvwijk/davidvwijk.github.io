# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech working with <a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/jburdick">Prof. Joel Burdick</a>. I received my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University under the supervision of <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/majji-manoranjan.html">Prof. Manoranjan Majji</a>, where I focused on developing provably safe control algorithms for autonomous systems. My research focuses on robotic and spacecraft applications, where I leverage insights from control theory, optimization, and estimation to enhance the reliability of autonomous operations in complex environments.
